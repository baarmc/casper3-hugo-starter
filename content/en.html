Brazil has many different types of wildlands, from rainforests and wetlands to savannas and deserts. These ecosystems host a wide range of animals and plants that are being destroyed by the increase of wildfires in these regions, even in the rainforests. 
Most of these fires are criminal fires, set by big landowners that want to clear the natural vegetation so they can use the area to cultivate monoculture crops or make pastures for cattle raising. And to make things worse the current government supports this practice, Which lead to a huge increase of fires in natural areas in the last four years <br>
Worried about this, we decided to organize an autonomous wildfire brigade.<br>
Our brigate main intent is to help to preserve the natural ecosystems, we are going to help in three different areas:
Remote sensing: Using data from satellites we can monitor fire danger variables like relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc.   The satellites also provide location of hotspots that may be wildfires. With this we can try to predict where and when we will need to act <br>
In our neighborhood there are many farms. The landowners are required, by law,  to keep part of the natural vegetation intact, inside their lands (20% in our region) these areas are called “reserva legal” (legal reservation)  . And also, they can’t grow crops or keep animals in areas that are less than 30 meters from river beds or areas with slope higher than 40 degrees. Many farmers don’t like to respect these laws and set fire   on this areas, so with the natural vegetation gone, they can use the area to get more profits. <br>
Wildfires that occur in Brazilian federal conservation units. Areas where most kinds of human interference are prohibited, but are also susceptible to criminal fires set by landowners that want to expand their lands. Brazil has two federal brigades that act in these conservation units, the ICMBio’s brigade (COIN) and IBAMA’s brigade (PREVFOGO). But it’s not enough to fight these huge fires, so we want to be able to help them.<br>
